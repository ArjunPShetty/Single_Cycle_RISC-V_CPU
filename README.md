# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-CPU
In this project, a 32-bit single-cycle RISC-V processor is designed and implemented using Verilog HDL. The processor is based on the RV32I instruction set and executes each instruction in a single clock cycle. The main aim of the project is to understand how a basic CPU works internally, including instruction fetch, decoding, execution, memory access, and write-back.

The design supports a subset of the RV32I instruction set, mainly arithmetic, logical, load, and store instructions. All components of the processor are designed as separate modules and then integrated at the top level to form a complete working system.
